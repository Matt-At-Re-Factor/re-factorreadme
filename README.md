#####**A Brief About Us**#####

Our guiding principle is to do good and do well and we try and live that every day. We enjoy helping software engineers and adjacent technical workers jobsearch and our intent is to introduce folks we work with to hiring teams building inclusive and enjoyable workdays and making interesting and useful software. We never lose sight of the notion that it's your job to go to every day and not ours so you make all the jobsearch decisions; we're just here to create introductions, help you interview and gather the information you need to make a good one.

#####**An Apt Sports Metaphor**#####

You are the player, the hiring companies we introduce you to are teams you could play for, their internal recruiters are scouts working for the team and we are a player agent working for you as you figure out where to land. Finding you a good workday is our goal. We trust our candidates to communicate clearly, professionally and directly with hiring teams throughout their interviews but—if you ever get stuck and aren't sure how to proceed in anyway—please do not hesitate to ask us (your agent) what approach we'd suggest.

#####**Tested Intentions, Observed Impact**#####

As stated above, there are three parties at work in an interview. They're all made up of people and people are prone to mistakes. If you see something, please say something. We work hard to vet our hiring teams as good actors, explicitly ask their intentions, understand their interview process, plan to mentor and manage the team you'd land on and dig into the overall health of the company. Intentions and perceptions don't always match impact or realities but we do our best to identify gaps, remove teams we're no longer confident in from our roster and focus on those who've proven to offer good outcomes.

#####**We Offer, We Ask**#####

We do our best to offer a thoughtful, curated interview process with as few surprises and as much context as possible with an aim towards a reasonable, comfortable salary which closely matches your ability and comes with achievable expectations. It is your salary so you determine what the ask is at the end of the day but we present that ask as a part of your candidate deck. Ideally, we'll have two or more workday ideas to introduce you to at once, we'll be evaluating a few options and considering several offers after a few weeks of jobsearch.

We come at your interview from a place of having given jobsearch _a lot_ of thought and having put in thousands of hours of observation. That much experience leads to opinions and perspective. If you ever feel we're overvaluing our experience and getting something particular to your search wrong, we hope you'll feel comfortable letting us know. We never stop learning and value your feedback.

In turn, we ask very little: please do your best to respond, answer, and update us when we reach out. We will actively work on your behalf and put a good deal of unseen time and effort into your search. Context helps a ton and how helpful we are is determined by how well we understand your search.

Please do let us know if you're getting close to fielding or taking other offers. We won't mind and it'll help us set the pace of your interviews with us. Please don't feel bad if you don't ultimately take a job we land you. We get it. We want you to have a good workday. Please don't worry about us trying to _sell you_ or coerce you in any way when it comes to taking a job. We don't do that. Please do let other folks know about your experience working with us. We're a small shop and we'd much rather spend time helping your friends jobsearch than cold-messaging folks on LinkedIn.
